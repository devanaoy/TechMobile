Personal Mobile App Project Final

About the app:

Users can browse and purchase tickets for a variety of events, including concerts, parties, and art exhibits, with this React Native app. The application features a menu with classified event options that is easy to use. The software allows users to choose an event category and then dynamically presents all of the events that fall into that category along with their names, dates, hours, costs, and the quantity of tickets that are still available. Users can reserve tickets for an event by choosing it, which opens a payment mode where they can enter their card information to finalize the transaction. To ensure accurate payment processing, the app also includes card number, expiration date, and CVV validation. Users receive a notice verifying their booking as soon as payment is approved, and the number of tickets available for the chosen event is subsequently reduced. All things considered, this app offers consumers a practical and effective way to find, investigate, and reserve tickets for a range of events.
